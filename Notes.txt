IFRAME TEMPLATE ISSUE NOTES:
	X-FRAME-OPTIONS Solution
		Child frame content decides if it's ok being loaded by the parent frame
		Either allow-all or .Remove()? or ask each client for their URL?
	Modals wider than 530px? WTF Vault.
		Make them smaller?
	Modal Masks
		Extend interface to mask outer frame
		Or have outer frame open the modal+mask
		Or leave it half-masked. It's probably fine.
	Handle top-frame redirect override for mobile-specific pages
		Mobile news etc isn't tall enough by default...?
	Handle Stylesheets provided by the parent?
	Deal with notemplate=1 being sticky? or require removal of template? or implement new way of eliminating the template for within iframes? Or load the template and have that be the way that stylesheets are loaded?
	Make sure to change every CIT.Master not just the UI/ one
